# saiyanWorkoutTracker


## Description

Just a very basic workout tracking app built from a pre-programmed foundation. The front end was already completed by the time I got it, so all I had to do was create a back-end and connect the two. 

Right now it is a bare-bones program but I plan to spruce it up to really make it an app I'd want to use.

No matter what you choose, you'll be able to add either a new cardio or resistance training set to the selected workout. Once you've added the data, click "Add Exercise" to add the exercise to the workout. When you're done adding exercises, click "complete" to go back to the landing page.

I'm interested in improving this app and will be doing so as soon as I have the time to do so. The things I can think of first are all aesthetic, though, so I welcome any suggestions on functionality updates.
