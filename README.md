# saiyanWorkoutTracker


## Description

Just a very basic workout tracking app built from a pre-programmed foundation. The front end was already completed by the time I got it, so all I had to do was create a back-end and connect the two. 

Right now it is a bare-bones program but I plan to spruce it up to really make it an app I'd want to use.
